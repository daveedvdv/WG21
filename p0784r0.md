# Standard containers and constexpr

### Introduction

Dynamically allocated container types, like `std::vector` or `std::unordered_map`, are generally useful and therefore also potentially useful for some constexpr computations. We also expect that they will be a necessity in the reflection and metaprogramming APIs that will emerge from the work in SG-7 (which decided that the preferred direction for a standard solution would involve constexpr-like computation). For example, querying the template arguments of a class type might look something like:

	std::vector<std::metainfo>
	    args = std::meta::get_template_args(reflexpr(T));

There are three aspects of `std::vector` that make it currently unusable in constexpr evaluations:

1. Destructors cannot be constexpr.
2. Dynamic memory allocation/deallocation isn't available.
3. In-place construction using placement-new isn't available.

### Destructors

The limitation that destructors cannot be constexpr is somewhat artificial: We can just lift the restriction. We have discussed the issues with the implementers of MSVC++ (Microsoft), GCC, Clang, and EDG's front end, and they all agreed that it would entail at most a minor cost in the performance of constexpr evaluations.

The proposed rules for constexpr destructors are:

* Destructors can be declared constexpr.
* Defaulted destructors are implicitly constexpr if their implementation does not call non-constexpr destructors.
* As an important special case, trivial destructors are implicitly constexpr.
* A literal type requires a constexpr destructor (previously, the stronger requirement of a trivial destructor was made).
* An object that has been destroyed (and not reconstructed --- see later) cannot be accessed during constexpr evaluation, even if its destructor is trivial.

FIXME: What about pseudo-destruction?

For a constexpr variable to be declared, we would extend the
requirement that the variable has a constant initializer with 
a second requirement that the variable has *constant 
destruction*. This means that the evaluation of the 
variable's destructor on the constant value produced by the 
initializer must also be a constant expression.


### Memory allocation

The memory implementation of the constexpr evaluator is unlike that of typical normal (run-time) program evaluation.Â  For example, it *must* be able to catch any form of undefined behavior. That means that the representation of a pointer or reference cannot just be an address: Additional metadata is needed to be able to relate the pointer to the bounds of the object it points into. Another example: Metadata is needed to know which field of a union is active.

Because of this, casting a raw memory pointer (say, a `void*`) into a pointer to an actual object is not generally viable. That removes the option of using something like

	void* operator new(std::size_t);
	
during constexpr evaluation: There is no reasonable way to turn the `void*` back into a `T*`.

Instead we can contemplate two other options:

1. Deal in terms of (non-placement) new- and delete-expressions.
2. Deal in terms of the standard allocator.

Both of these provide *typed* storage that doesn't require further reinterpretation. We can therefore establish rules that make them work "magically" during constexpr evaluation (without evaluating the underlying raw storage pointer arithmetic or pointer reinterpretations).  We'll discuss those rules further on, but one guiding principle is that memory that is dynamically allocated during constexpr evaluation cannot just "escape" into the run time implementation.

### In-place construction

Standard containers rely on the ability to separate the allocation and construction of objects through the `std::allocator_traits`' interface. In particular, `std::allocator_traits<A>::construct` is a typed API that just turns around and calls a non-typed placement-new-expression ("non-typed" because the extra-parameter of the placement-new operator is `void*`).  Although we cannot make the general placement-new mechanism work in constexpr evaluation, we *can* decree that:

	new(ptr) T{...}
	
is a valid core constant expression if `ptr` is obtained by a standard conversion from a `T*` pointer value that points to a "dead object":

* the storage of object of type `T` that has been destroyed and not yet (in part or in whole) reconstructed, or
* type `T` storage that has been obtained from the default allocator and in which no object has yet been constructed.

For example:

    #include <memory>
    using namespace std;
    constexpr double f(int n) {
      allocator<double> a;
      double *b = a.alloc(n)
      for (double *p = b; p-b<n; ++p) {
        new(p) double{0.0+(p-b)};
      }
    #ifdef NEG
    new(p) double{0.0};
      // Constexpr evaluation would fail because
      // p already points to a live object.
    #endif
      double r = 0.0;
      for (double *p = b; p-b<n; ++p) {
        r += *p;
      }
      a.deallocate(p, n);
      return r;
    }
    constexpr double d = f(7);


### Non-transient allocation

During a constexpr evaluation, any allocated storage that is
deallocated before the evaluation completes poses few 
problems: We call those constexpr allocations *transient*. 
We'll decree that the overall result of a constant expression 
cannot contain a pointer or reference to storage from a 
transient allocation. (Note that since C++14, a compiler is 
allowed to optimize away certain allocations and 
deallocations, and the *transient* constexpr allocation rules 
can be interpreted as mandating such elision for constexpr 
evaluations.)

What about storage that hasn't been deallocated by the time evaluation completes?  We could just disallow that, but there are really compelling use cases where this might be desirable. E.g., this could be the basis for a more flexible kind of "string literal" class.  We therefore propose that if a non-transient constexpr allocation is valid (to be described next), the allocated objects are promoted to static storage duration.  A constexpr evaluation of an expression *expr* can refer to a *non-transient* allocation if:

* *expr* is a full expression in a context that requires a constant expression, and
* the result of evaluating *expr* is an object with a nontrivial constexpr destructor, and
* evaluating that destructor would be a valid core constant expression and would deallocate all the *non-transient* allocations produced by the evaluation of *expr*.

For example:

    #include <memory>
    using namespace std;
    template<typename T> struct S: allocator<T> {
      T *ps;
      int sz;
      template<int N> constexpr S(T (&p)[N])
                              : sz{N}
                              , ps{this->allocate(N)} {
        for (int k = 0; k<N; ++k) {
          new(this->ps+k) T{p[k]};
        }
      }
      constexpr ~S() {
        for (int k = 0; k<this->sz; ++k) {
          (this->ps+k)->T::~T();
        }
        this->deallocate(this->ps, this->sz);
      }
    };
    
    constexpr S<char> str("Hello!");
      // str ends up pointing to a static array
      // containing the string "Hello!".
      
The constructor evaluation in this example is successful, producing an `S` object that points to a non-transient constexpr allocation. Running the destructor would also be successful and would deallocate the non-transient allocation. The non-transient allocation is therefore promoted to static storage.
