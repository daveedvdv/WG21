<h1 align="center"><tt>std::is_constexpr_evaluated()</tt></h1>

<h3>Introduction and Motivation</h3>

<p>
We propose a "magical" library function that is predeclared
as follows:
<pre><tt>
namespace std {
  constexpr bool is_constexpr_evaluated() noexcept;
}
</pre></tt>
(No standard header inclusion or module import is needed
to make it available.)
</p>
	
<p>
This function could be used as follows:
</p>
<pre><tt>
    constexpr double power(double b, int x) {
      if (std::is_constexpr_evaluated() && x >= 0) {
        // A constant-evaluation context: Use a
	// constexpr-friendly algorithm.
        double r = 1.0, p = b;
        unsigned u = (unsigned)x;
        while (u != 0) {
          if (u & 1) r *= p;
          u /= 2;
          p *= p;
        }
        return r;
      } else {
        // Let the code generator figure it out.
        return std::pow(b, (double)x);
      }
    }
    
    constexpr double kilo = power(10.0, 3);  // (1)
    int n = 3;
    double mucho = power(10.0, n);  // (2)
    double thousand() {
      return power(10.0, 3);
    }
</pre></tt>
    
<p>
Call (1) occurs in a constant-expression context, and, therefore,
<tt>std::in_constexpr_call()</tt> will be <tt>true</tt> during the
computation of <tt>power(10.0, 3)</tt>, which in turn allows the
evaluation to complete as a constant-expression.
</p>
<p>
Call (2) isn't a constant-expression because <tt>n</tt> cannot be
converted to an rvalue in a constant-expression context. So it will
be evaluated in a context where <tt>std::is_constexpr_evaluated()</tt>
is <tt>false</tt>; this is known at translation time, and the
run-time code generated for the function can therefore easily be
reduced to the equivalent of just
<pre><tt>
    inline double power'(double b, int x) {
      return std::pow(b, (double)x);
    }
</pre></tt>
</p>
<p>
Call (3) is a core constant expression, but an implementation is
not required to evaluate it at compile time.  We therefore specify
that it causes <tt>std::is_constexpr_evaluated()</tt> to produce
<tt>false</tt>.  It's tempting to leave it unspecified whether
<tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt> is produced in that case, but that
raises significant semantic concerns: The answer could then
become inconsistent across various stages of the compilation.
For example:
<pre><tt>
  int *p, *invalid;
  constexpr bool is_valid() {
    return std::is_constexpr_evaluated() ? true : p != invalid;
  }
  constexpr int get() { return is_valid() ? *p : abort(); }
</pre></tt>	
This example tries to count on the fact that constexpr evaluation
detects undefined behavior to avoid the non-constexpr-friendly
call to <tt>abort()</tt> at compile time.  However, if
<tt>std::is_constexpr_evaluated()</tt> can return <tt>true</tt>, we
now end up with a situation where an important run-time check is
by-passed.
</p>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>
Ideally, we'd like this function to return <tt>true</tt> when it is evaluated at
compile time, and <tt>false</tt> otherwise.  However, the standard doesn't actually
make a distinction between "compile time" and "run time", and hence a more careful
specification is needed, one that fits the standard framework of "constant
expressions".
</p>
<p>
Our approach is to precisely identify a set of expressions that are "required to
be constant-evaluated" (a new technical phrase) and specify that our new function
returns <tt>true</tt> during the evaluation of such expressions and <tt>false</tt>
otherwise.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, we include two kinds of expressions in our set of expressions
"required to be constant-evaluated".  The first kind is straightforward:
Expressions in contexts where the standard already requires a constant result,
such as the dimension of an array or the initializer of a constexpr variable.
</p>
<p>
The second kind is a little more subtle: Expressions appearing in the initializers
of variables that are not constexpr, but whose "constant-ness" has a significant
semantic effect.
Consider the following example:
<pre><tt>
  template<int> struct X {};
  constexpr auto f() {
    int const N = std::is_constexpr_evaluated() ? 13 : 17;
    X<N> x1;
    X<std::is_constexpr_evaluated() ? 13 : 17> x2;
</pre></tt>
We want to ensure that <tt>x1</tt> and <tt>x2</tt> have the same type.  However,
the initializer of <tt>N</tt>, in itself, it not required to have a constant
value.  It's only when we use <tt>N</tt> as a template argument later on that
the requirement of a constant value arises, but by then a compiler already has
committed its decision regarding the result of <tt>std::is_constexpr_evaluated()</tt>.
In contrast, the second evaluation of <tt>std::is_constexpr_evaluated()</tt> falls
squarely in the first kind of expressions "required to be constant-evaluated".
</p>
<p>
Our approach for the second kind, then, is to specify that the initializer for a
variable whose "constant-ness" matters for the semantics of the program is also
"required to beconstant-evaluated" if evaluating it with
<tt>std::is_constexpr_evaluated() == true</tt> would produce a constant.
(The variables for which "constant-ness" matters are those of reference type or 
non-volatile const integral type because they can be used to form constant values,
as well as those of non-automatic storage duration because the "constant-ness" of
their initializers can affect initialization timing.)
This implies that compilers have to perform a "tentative constant evaluation" for
the initializers of such variables.  Fortunately, that is already what current
implementations do.
</p>
	
<p>
As the introductory example shows, <tt>std::is_constexpr_evaluated()</tt>
is useful to enable alternative implementations of functions for
compile time when the corresponding implementation for run time 
would not comply to the constraints of core constant expressions.
A forthcoming important special case of this principle is
<tt>std::string</tt>: P0578 (already approved by EWG) enables
constexpr destructors, allocation, and deallocation, which in
principle allows for the support of constexpr container types.
However, <tt>std::string</tt> implementations typically include
a "short string optimization" that is unfriendly to the constexpr
evaluation constraints: With the facility presented here, the
implementation of <tt>std::string</tt> can avoid the short
string optimization when evaluation happens at compile time.
(In turn, the ability to produce <tt>std::string</tt> objects at
compile time is expected to be beneficial for reflection
interfaces.)
</p>

<p>
A previous version of this paper was presented in Kona (2017) using
the special-purpose notation <tt>constexpr()</tt> instead of a (magic)
library function call.  The following two poll results were
recorded at the time:
<blockquote>
	The constexpr operator as presented?<br/>
	SF: 4 | F: 13 | N: 7 | A: 2 | SA: 2
<br/><br/>
	Same feature with a magic library function?<br/>
	SF: 5 | F: 12 | N: 5 | A: 2 | SA: 1
</blockquote>
